## Installation

### Setting up GitHub Packages Access

Since this package is published to GitHub Packages, you'll need to authenticate first:

1. **Create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)**:
   - Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
   - Create a token with `read:packages` scope
   - Save the token securely

2. **Configure npm to use GitHub Packages**:

   ```bash
   # Add to your ~/.npmrc or project .npmrc
   @uniswap:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
   //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
   ```

3. **Install the package**:

   ```bash
   npm install @uniswap/spec-workflow-mcp
   ```

### Using with npx

For one-time use with npx, you can set the token as an environment variable:

```bash
NODE_AUTH_TOKEN=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN npx @uniswap/spec-workflow-mcp@latest /path/to/project --dashboard
```

## Features

- **Structured Development Workflow** - Sequential spec creation (Requirements → Design → Tasks)
- **Real-Time Web Dashboard** - Monitor specs, tasks, and progress with live updates
- **Document Management** - View and manage all spec documents from the dashboard
- **Task Progress Tracking** - Visual progress bars and detailed task status
- **Steering Documents** - Project vision, technical decisions, and structure guidance
- **Bug Workflow** - Complete bug reporting and resolution tracking
- **Template System** - Pre-built templates for all document types
- **Cross-Platform** - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Quick Start

> **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have [configured GitHub Packages access](#setting-up-github-packages-access) before proceeding.

1. **Add to your AI tool configuration** (see MCP Client Setup below):

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "spec-workflow": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@uniswap/spec-workflow-mcp@latest", "/path/to/your/project"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **Note:** Can be used without path to your project, but some MCP clients may not start the server from the current directory.

2. **Start the web dashboard** (**REQUIRED**):

   ```bash
   # Default (uses ephemeral port)
   npx -y @uniswap/spec-workflow-mcp@latest /path/to/your/project --dashboard

   # Custom port
   npx -y @uniswap/spec-workflow-mcp@latest /path/to/your/project --dashboard --port 3000

   # Alternative syntax
   npx -y @uniswap/spec-workflow-mcp@latest /path/to/your/project --dashboard --port=8080
   ```

   **Options:**
   - `--dashboard` - Start the web dashboard (required)
   - `--port <number>` - Optional custom port (1024-65535). If not specified, an ephemeral port will be used

   **IMPORTANT:** The dashboard is mandatory for the workflow to function. Without it:
   - Document approvals won't work
   - Task progress tracking will be disabled
   - Spec status updates won't be available
   - The approval system will be non-functional

**Note:** The MCP server and dashboard are now separate services. You must run both: the MCP server for AI tool integration AND the dashboard for workflow management, approvals, and progress tracking.

## How to Use

You can simply mention spec-workflow or whatever name you gave the MCP server in your conversation. The AI will handle the complete workflow automatically or you can use some of the example prompts below:

### Creating Specs

- **"Create a spec for user authentication"** - Creates complete spec workflow for that feature
- **"Create a spec called payment-system"** - Builds full requirements → design → tasks
- **"Build a spec for @prd"** - Takes your existing PRD and creates the complete spec workflow from it
- **"Create a spec for shopping-cart - include add to cart, quantity updates, and checkout integration"** - Detailed feature spec

### Getting Information

- **"List my specs"** - Shows all specs and their current status
- **"Show me the user-auth progress"** - Displays detailed progress information

### Implementation

- **"Execute task 1.2 in spec user-auth"** - Runs a specific task from your spec
- **Copy prompts from dashboard** - Use the "Copy Prompt" button in the task list on your dashboard

The agent automatically handles approval workflows, task management, and guides you through each phase.

- **Document Navigation** - Switch between requirements, design, and tasks
- **Task Management** - View task progress and copy implementation prompts
- **Real-Time Updates** - WebSocket connection for live project status

## Workflow Process

### 1. Project Setup (Recommended)

```
steering-guide → create-steering-doc (product, tech, structure)
```

Creates foundational documents to guide your project development.

### 2. Feature Development

```
spec-workflow-guide → create-spec-doc → [review] → implementation
```

Sequential process: Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation

### 3. Implementation Support

- Use `get-spec-context` for detailed implementation context
- Use `manage-tasks` to track task completion
- Monitor progress via the web dashboard

## File Structure

```
your-project/
  .spec-workflow/
    steering/
      product.md        # Product vision and goals
      tech.md          # Technical decisions
      structure.md     # Project structure guide
    specs/
      {spec-name}/
        requirements.md # What needs to be built
        design.md      # How it will be built
        tasks.md       # Implementation breakdown
    approval/
      {spec-name}/
        {document-id}.json # Approval status tracking
```

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Run in development mode (with auto-reload)
npm run dev

# Start the production server
npm start

# Clean build artifacts
npm run clean
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Dashboard not starting**
   - Ensure you're using the `--dashboard` flag when starting the dashboard service
   - The dashboard must be started separately from the MCP server
   - Check console output for the dashboard URL and any error messages
   - If using `--port`, ensure the port number is valid (1024-65535) and not in use by another application

2. **Approvals not working**
   - Verify the dashboard is running alongside the MCP server
   - The dashboard is required for document approvals and task tracking
   - Check that both services are pointing to the same project directory

3. **MCP server not connecting**
   - Verify the file paths in your configuration are correct
   - Ensure the project has been built with `npm run build`
   - Check that Node.js is available in your system PATH

4. **Port conflicts**
   - If you get a "port already in use" error, try a different port with `--port <different-number>`
   - Use `netstat -an | find ":3000"` (Windows) or `lsof -i :3000` (macOS/Linux) to check what's using a port
   - Omit the `--port` parameter to automatically use an available ephemeral port

5. **Dashboard not updating**
   - The dashboard uses WebSockets for real-time updates
   - Refresh the browser if connection is lost
   - Check console for any JavaScript errors
