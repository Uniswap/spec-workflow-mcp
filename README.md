   ```

2. **VSCode Extension** (Recommended for VSCode users)
   - Install from [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Pimzino.spec-workflow-mcp)
   - No separate dashboard needed - integrated into VSCode

See [SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md#user-interface-options) for detailed interface options.

## How to Use

You can simply mention spec-workflow or whatever name you gave the MCP server in your conversation. The AI will handle the complete workflow automatically or you can use some of the example prompts below:

### Creating Specs

- **"Create a spec for user authentication"** - Creates complete spec workflow for that feature
- **"Create a spec called payment-system"** - Builds full requirements â†’ design â†’ tasks
- **"Build a spec for @prd"** - Takes your existing PRD and creates the complete spec workflow from it
- **"Create a spec for shopping-cart - include add to cart, quantity updates, and checkout integration"** - Detailed feature spec

### Getting Information

- **"List my specs"** - Shows all specs and their current status
- **"Show me the user-auth progress"** - Displays detailed progress information

### Implementation

- **"Execute task 1.2 in spec user-auth"** - Runs a specific task from your spec
- **Copy prompts from dashboard** - Use the "Copy Prompt" button in the task list on your dashboard

The agent automatically handles approval workflows, task management, and guides you through each phase.
